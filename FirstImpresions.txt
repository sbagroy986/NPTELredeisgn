Navbar: 
- Color scheme (NPTEL bg white)
- Should move unnecessary options to navbar

Footer:
- Condense course type width (types of courses)
- Footer layout and design (yuck)

Home page:
- Way too many options
- Wtf is "speech to text"
- NPTEL chapter necessary above the fold?
- Gate preperation not relevant to main idea behind the website
- NPTEL workshop useless
- Featured courses and New courses?
- Clicking on IIT logos redirect to courses or website?

Courses:
- "New" completely cover the page, pointless
- Search bar on top and on the side
- "Filter" not "List"
- Search options unclear/unintuitive
- Each course box is scrollable, not intuitive or best approach to represent data
- "NOC"???
- Link the photos


Tasks:
- Search for PSOSM course, find the FAQs
- Find the contact us page
- Find courses with no videos
- Find Agriculture courses
- Find videos with the word mean velocity
- Find lectures with the word "machine" in it

Anupama:
- Lot of content
- Search is way too slow
- Not intuitive that no FAQs
- Footer contact us, not hard to find
- Web courses found
- Didn't use footer to find Agriculture
- Used search bar on top to find mean velocity
- Took 3 turns, went through all search bars
- Multiple search bars
- Too much to digest
- Consistency of course display
- Hard to navigate course pages, search features not intuitive
- Search within video not clear at all
- Arrow should change
- Frame FAQ questions better

Kushagra:
- Resources page is not intuitive
- Not intuitive that FAQs are absent
- Home page confusing
- Contact us not on the navbar
- Does not use footer for finding Agricultute courses
- Enter does not work in search bar
